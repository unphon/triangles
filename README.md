Triangles are classified according to the length of their sides or the measure of their angles. These classifications come in threes, just like the sides and angles themselves.

The following are triangle classifications based on sides:
- Scalene triangle: A triangle with no congruent sides
- Isosceles triangle: A triangle with at least two congruent sides
- Equilateral triangle: A triangle with three congruent sides
